    Code shared with other (non-POSIX) reactors for management of general
    outgoing connections.

    Requirements upon subclasses are documented as instance variables rather
    than abstract methods, in order to avoid MRO confusion, since this base is
    mixed in to unfortunately weird and distinctive multiple-inheritance
    hierarchies and many of these attributes are provided by peer classes
    rather than descendant classes in those hierarchies.

    @ivar addressFamily: The address family constant (C{socket.AF_INET},
        C{socket.AF_INET6}, C{socket.AF_UNIX}) of the underlying socket of this
        client connection.
    @type addressFamily: C{int}

        C{socket.SOCK_DGRAM}) of the underlying socket.

    @ivar _requiresResolution: A flag indicating whether the address of this
        client will require name resolution.  C{True} if the hostname of said
        address indicates a name that must be resolved by hostname lookup,
        C{False} if it indicates an IP address literal.
    @type _requiresResolution: C{bool}

        indicates the L{Connection}-alike class to invoke C{__init__} and
        C{connectionLost} on.

        this transport from its reactor's notifications in response to a
        terminated connection attempt.

        in response to a terminated connection attempt.

        its underlying OS resource (such as a file descriptor or file handle),
        as part of post connection-failure cleanup.
