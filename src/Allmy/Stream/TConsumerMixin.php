/**
 * L{IConsumer} implementations can mix this in to get C{registerProducer} and
 * C{unregisterProducer} methods which take care of keeping track of a
 * producer's state.
 * 
 * Subclasses must provide three attributes which L{_ConsumerMixin} will read
 * but not write:
 * 
 * - connected: A C{bool} which is C{True} as long as the the consumer has
 * someplace to send bytes (for example, a TCP connection), and then
 * C{False} when it no longer does.
 * 
 * - disconnecting: A C{bool} which is C{False} until something like
 * L{ITransport.loseConnection} is called, indicating that the send buffer
 * should be flushed and the connection lost afterwards.  Afterwards,
 * C{True}.
 * 
 * - disconnected: A C{bool} which is C{False} until the consumer no longer
 * has a place to send bytes, then C{True}.

 * Subclasses must also override the C{startWriting} method.
 * 
 * @ivar producer: C{None} if no producer is registered, otherwise the
 * registered producer.

 * @ivar producerPaused: A flag indicating whether the producer is currently
 * paused.
 * @type producerPaused: C{bool} or C{int}
 * 
 * @ivar streamingProducer: A flag indicating whether the producer was
 * registered as a streaming (ie push) producer or not (ie a pull
 * producer).  This will determine whether the consumer may ever need to
 * pause and resume it, or if it can merely call C{resumeProducing} on it
 * when buffer space is available.
 * @ivar streamingProducer: C{bool} or C{int}

        This sets this selectable to be a consumer for a producer.  When this
        selectable runs out of data on a write() call, it will ask the producer
        to resumeProducing(). When the FileDescriptor's internal data buffer is
        filled, it will ask the producer to pauseProducing(). If the connection
        is lost, FileDescriptor calls producer's stopProducing() method.

        If streaming is true, the producer should provide the IPushProducer
        interface. Otherwise, it is assumed that producer provides the
        IPullProducer interface. In this case, the producer won't be asked to
        pauseProducing(), but it has to be careful to write() data only when its
        resumeProducing() method is called.
