        Perform an AXFR record lookup.

        NB This is quite different from other DNS requests. See
        U{http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/axfr-notes.html} for more
        information.

        NB Unlike other C{lookup*} methods, the timeout here is not a
        list of ints, it is a single int.

        @type name: C{str}
        @param name: DNS name to resolve.

        @type timeout: C{int}
        @param timeout: When this timeout expires, the query is
            considered failed.

        @rtype: L{Deferred}
        @return: A L{Deferred} which fires with a three-tuple of lists of
            L{twisted.names.dns.RRHeader} instances.
            The first element of the tuple gives answers.
            The second and third elements are always empty.
            The L{Deferred} may instead fail with one of the
            exceptions defined in L{twisted.names.error} or with
            C{NotImplementedError}.
